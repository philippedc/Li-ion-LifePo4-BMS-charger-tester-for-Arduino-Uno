# Li-ion-LifePo4-BMS-charger-tester-for-Arduino-Uno
The objective of this project is to build a charging and testing device that can be universal, for a different among of cells to charge and for different technologies. The Arduino Uno based device, manage voltage readings, and according to results manages cells’ shunt or a buzzer. A SSD screen displays where we are. A buck DC-DC converter adjust the charging voltage for a constant charging current.

•	It can charge simultaneously from 1 to 4 cells

•	Cells can be either Lithium-ion technology  – for instance 18650 – or LifePo4 cells (you cannot mix)

•	Monitoring of any cells voltage, plus overall voltage

•	A internal protection against short circuit also limit for a constant current of about 1 A – hardware setup –

•	Any power supply DC 17V to 25V @ 1.5A can fit this device. An internal buck DC-DC converter adapt the needed voltage value. A old DC 19V laptop power supply is perfect

•	The balancing is performed by shunts between cells

•	Under voltage alarm by buzzer

The manual - the pdf file - describes how to build such a BMS 1S…4S charger / tester.
